## UX

For this website I wanted to create something that was minimalistic but still provided users with what they needed. When they enter the site they are immediately shown the bands logo/name, you know you are in the right place. The homepage as it loads is the bands logo as 100% height of the users device, they know where they are and they can quickly navigate to relevant sections of the website. New and old fans can also scroll down for a quick overview of the band and see what they are currently involved with.

- As a new fan I want to find out more about the bands music and their band members, I can do this by navigating to the "listen" and "About us" section of the website. In these sections I will be able to hear the bands latest song and read a snippet about the band members and the band as a whole. If I like this band I want to be able to navigate to the bands available socila media accounts, the footer has links to these.
- As an existing fan I want to see what the latest news from the band is and support the band by purchasing music, I can do this by navigating to the "news" and "listen" sections or by scrolling down the home page. 
- As someone looking to hire the band I can quickly navigate to the "Book us" section. Here I will see an overview of what the band can offer. 

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
